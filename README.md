The Extrasolar Transit Calculator
----------------------------------

This code calculates the expected transits of an extrasolar planet. The source data 
(data.dat file) is taken from exoplanets.eu.

To run the code is very simple. Just do:

    python etc.py

And write the name of the planet and the desired year and month for which you wish 
to predict transits. The code also displays airmasses; these make sense with the 
observatory data that is in the code that you can modify to suit your needs.
